A simple example of a Go server which distributes Server Side Events

A simple example for the Adafruit 0.56" 4-Digit 7-Segment Display w/I2C Backpack

The Templates Directory holds the files to be served, which must be in the directory of the application binary.

The contents of the 7 Segment Display will be served on:

http://locahost:8000/test

HTML 5 browser required.

The demo app runs through a couple of different displays, timer countdowns and clock displays. These are mirrored on connected web browsers.

Note: When the '----' appears on the 7 segment display, the 7 segment display will blink. Attached web pages do *not* blink.
